                        Depression is one of the world's leading mental illnesses not just in teenagers, but also in adults. Depression is caused by multiple factors of stress and trauma from previous experiences, leading to the feeling of hopelessness, lack of motivation, suicidal urges, change in demeanor and much more. One way to deal with depression is to reach out for support whether through trusted friends, family, or a mental health professional so you don’t carry the burden alone.

                        Anxiety involves excessive worry, restlessness, and physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat and sweating. To manage it, relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can calm the body’s stress response. Grounding techniques, like focusing on one’s senses or surroundings, also help in moments of panic. Cognitive strategies, such as challenging irrational thoughts, can prevent worry from spiraling.
